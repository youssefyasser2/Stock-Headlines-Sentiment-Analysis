# Understanding Emotional States through Text Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that analyzes text to detect emotional states, with a particular emphasis on identifying negative emotions like sadness, anger, and frustration. As people increasingly share their emotions and experiences online, it becomes crucial to identify emotional cues that may indicate distress or mental health concerns. This system aims to automate the process of emotion detection from text, helping to highlight potential signs of emotional distress in real time.

The project involves creating an emotion-detection model trained on a carefully preprocessed dataset. By using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model will classify text based on emotional markers, distinguishing between various emotional tones such as sadness and frustration. The goal is to provide a tool that can support mental health awareness and potentially offer early interventions through the automated identification of distress signals in online communication.

Key objectives include:

Building a model to classify emotions in text, with a focus on negative emotions.
Preprocessing and cleaning text data to improve classification accuracy.
Refining the model to understand subtle differences between emotions.
Creating a real-time tool for emotion detection that can be applied to mental health and sentiment tracking applications.
This project has the potential to improve how we monitor and respond to emotional cues in online communication, offering valuable insights into mental health trends and enabling faster interventions.
